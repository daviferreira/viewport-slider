# ViewportSlider

ViewportSlider is a pure JavaScript implementation of Apple's product page showcase (ie. http://www.apple.com/iphone-5c/).

# Basic usage

First, you need to attach ViewportSlider stylesheet to your page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/viewport-slider.css">
```

The next step is to reference the slider script and initialize the ViewportSlider object:

```html
<script src="js/viewport-slider.js"></script>
<script>viewportSlider.init(document.getElementById('container'), '.slide');</script>
```

The above code will transform all the elements with the .slide class into full viewport slides and add a navigation behavior to them (either by using the mousewheel/trackpad and keyboard or by clicking on the navigation bullets). The initialization receives two parameters: the root element for the slides and the slides' class name.

## Touch Support

To enable swipe pagination, ViewportSlider uses the awesome [Hammer Library](http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/). You need to reference it manually. The lib directory includes the latest version:

```html
<script src="js/hammer.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/viewport-slider.js"></script>
<script>viewportSlider.init(document.getElementById('container'), '.slide');</script>
```

## Development

ViewportSlider development tasks are managed by Grunt. To install all the necessary packages, just invoke:

```bash
npm install
```

These are the available grunt tasks:

* __js__: runs jslint and jasmine tests and creates minified and concatenated versions of the script;
* __css__: runs compass and csslint
* __test__: runs jasmine tests, jslint and csslint
* __watch__: watch for modifications on script/scss files

The source files are located inside the __src__ directory. ViewportSlider stylesheet was created using sass/compass, make sure you have the compass gem installed on your system.

## Methods

Use can use the following method to switch manually between the slides.

```javascript
viewportSlider.paginate(index, callback);
```
